## Road Traffic Accident Analysis & Severity Prediction (UK 2020 Data)
This project explores road traffic accident patterns, identifies key factors contributing to accident occurrence, and builds machine learning models to predict accident severity using the Great Britain Road Accident 2020 dataset.
The work combines data mining, predictive modelling, clustering, association rule mining, and exploratory analysis to derive meaningful insights for road safety improvement.
## Project Overview
Road accidents occur unexpectedly and often lead to loss, injuries, and fatalities. Understanding the contributing factors is essential for improving road safety.
This project:
•	Analyzes accident patterns across demographics, time, road conditions, and vehicle types
•	Identifies significant predictors of accident severity
•	Uses clustering to map accident hotspots
•	Employs association rule mining to uncover variable relationships
•	Builds classification models to predict fatal or non-fatal severity
•	Proposes evidence-based recommendations to reduce accident rates
The dataset is sourced from Great Britain Road Accident Data (2020).
## Methodology
Methodology
1. Data Cleaning

Cleaning was performed for four datasets:

Accident Table (36 columns, 91,199 rows)

Vehicle Table (28 columns, 167,375 rows)

Casualty Table (19 columns, 115,584 rows)

LSOA Table (7 columns, 34,378 rows)

Key processes included:

Removing irrelevant columns

Handling missing values (e.g., replacing -1 in driver’s age with mean value 34; assigning “unknown” where needed)

Fixing inconsistencies

One-hot encoding for mining algorithms
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Accident Demographics

Majority of accident casualties are males aged 25–55

Male casualties dominate the 26–35 age group

Severity Frequency

78% of accidents: Fatal (labelled as moderate in dataset)

20%: Non-fatal

<2%: Severe

Time & Day Patterns

Peak accident times: 8 AM, 3–5 PM

Highest accident day: Friday

Lowest accident day: Sunday

Motorcycle Accident Insights

Across all motorcycle categories:

Peak hours: 3–6 PM

Peak days: Fridays, except >500cc bikes peaking on Sundays

Pedestrian Accidents

Increase from 8 AM (school/work rush hour)

Peak at 3 PM (returning from school/work)

Highest day: Friday
## Environmental & Road Condition Insights

Most accidents occur on dry road surfaces (people stay indoors during snow/ice)

Weather-related accidents more common during low wind speeds

Fewer accidents in winter due to lower traffic volume
## Clustering Analysis

Two clustering techniques were used:

KMeans Clustering

Optimal number of clusters: 5, based on the Elbow Method

Accident hotspots identified in:

Hull

Hessle

Bridlington

Scunthorpe

DBSCAN

Revealed dense clusters without pre-defining cluster count

Useful for identifying irregular spatial patterns
## Outlier Detection

Methods used:

IQR

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Isolation Forest

Findings:

Mild outliers detected

Some clustering around London area

Outliers indicate unusual road or environmental conditions influencing accidents
## Machine Learning: Severity Prediction

Goal: Predict fatal vs non-fatal accident severity.

Feature Importance

Using Random Forest:

Top 10 features selected

Most influential factors included environment, location, and vehicle attributes

Model Training & Tuning

Technique: Random Forest Classifier

Best hyperparameters (via Grid Search)

## Model Performance

Accuracy: 61%

Precision: 60%

F1 Score: 63%

The model demonstrates moderate predictive ability but requires improvement (e.g., more feature engineering, handling class imbalance, additional models like XGBoost).
## Recommendations for Road Safety

Traffic Awareness & Law Enforcement
Increase awareness campaigns, especially for Fridays and peak hours.

Infrastructure Improvements

Better sidewalks and pedestrian crossings

Adjust traffic lights

Reduce speed limits in pedestrian-heavy areas

Motorcycle Lane Marking
Provide clearer lane markings for motorcycles to reduce lane-intrusion accidents.

Dualization of Urban Roads
Convert single-lane urban roads into dual carriageways to reduce congestion and collision rates.
